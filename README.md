## What brings you to my page? ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Adithya Sharma**, From Coding Algorithms & Building Intelligent Systems to Intraday Trading, I'm always looking for ways to optimize and improve to stay ahead of the curve. And when it's time to unwind, nothing beats a good game of cricket, or a tough session of KickBoxing. 


**Here are some ideas to get you started**:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently contributing my part as an SDE to build India's Healthcare Exchange.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Web Automation**, **FastAPI**, **DevOps**, **AlgoTrding**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **API**, **Data Science**, **Automation** Projects. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: **Trading**, **Deep Learning**, **Finance**.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an Avid Trekker, Explorer and I'm obsessed with the Adrenaline Rush<br> and sense of freedom that only **SNOW** Mountains can provide.
